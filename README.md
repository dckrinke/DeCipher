========

Fun solving simple substitution ciphers - let the computer take care of the tedious details. 
This is a Windows 8 app. 
The program displays white text on black background. 

On program initialization, a random quote is selected from the quote database. 
A simple substitution cypher is selected. 
A help screen is displayed. 

The app has one button and one text box (input cell). 
The app only responds to button clicks. 

The enciphered quote is displayed, along with letter frequency count. 

The goal is to decipher the quote and to enjoy doing so. 

When you think you know what one enciphered letter is in plaintext, then 
enter those two letters into the text box and press the button. 
Say you think that the letter X is actually E. 
Enter X E into the text box and press the button. 

The app assists you in deciphering the quote by scanning through the cipher 
and placing an E underneath each X. 

As you correctly guess more and more letters, plain text words appear under the cipher. 

The goal is to solve the cipher by correctly guessing each letter in the cipher.
